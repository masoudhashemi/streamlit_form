# Use Streamlit to Create a Form

The Questions are read from the 'info.yaml' file. If the answer to the question is `A` there are no detailed questions, otherwise the detailed questions are read from the 'info.yaml' file.

The answers are stored in a CSV file.

You can generate an markdown report from the form.

Run the app with:
'''bash
streamlit run app_yaml.py
